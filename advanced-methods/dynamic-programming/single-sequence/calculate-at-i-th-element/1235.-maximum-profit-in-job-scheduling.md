# 1235. Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling

## Question

We have `n` jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from `startTime[i]` to `endTime[i]`, obtaining a profit of `profit[i]`.

You're given the `startTime`, `endTime` and `profit` arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time `X` you will be able to start another job that starts at time `X`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
Output: 6
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= profit[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int jobScheduling(vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime, vector<int>& profit) {
        // sol: sort, hashmap, 1D dp, binary search (upper bound)
        int n = startTime.size();
        vector<vector<int>> jobs; // {endTime, startTime, profit}
        map<int, int> dp; // dp[ent_time]: max profit before end_time
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            jobs.push_back({endTime[i], startTime[i], profit[i]});
        }
        sort(jobs.begin(), jobs.end());
        for (auto job : jobs) {
            auto it = prev(dp.upper_bound(job[1]));
            int profit = it->second + job[2];
            if (profit > dp.rbegin()->second) {
                dp[job[0]] = profit;
            }
        }
        return dp.rbegin()->second;
    }
};
```
