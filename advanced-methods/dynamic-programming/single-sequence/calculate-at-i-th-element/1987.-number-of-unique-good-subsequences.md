# 1987. Number of Unique Good Subsequences

## Question

You are given a binary string `binary`. A **subsequence** of `binary` is considered **good** if it is **not empty** and has **no leading zeros** (with the exception of `"0"`).

Find the number of **unique good subsequences** of `binary`.

* For example, if `binary = "001"`, then all the **good** subsequences are `["0", "0", "1"]`, so the **unique** good subsequences are `"0"` and `"1"`. Note that subsequences `"00"`, `"01"`, and `"001"` are not good because they have leading zeros.

Return _the number of **unique good subsequences** of_ `binary`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: binary = "001"
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong><strong>Explanation: The good subsequences of binary are ["0", "0", "1"].
</strong>The unique good subsequences are "0" and "1".
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: binary = "11"
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong><strong>Explanation: The good subsequences of binary are ["1", "1", "11"].
</strong>The unique good subsequences are "1" and "11".
</code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: binary = "101"
</strong><strong>Output: 5
</strong><strong>Explanation: The good subsequences of binary are ["1", "0", "1", "10", "11", "101"]. 
</strong>The unique good subsequences are "0", "1", "10", "11", and "101".
</code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= binary.length <= 105`
* `binary` consists of only `'0'`s and `'1'`s.

## Solution

#### Java

```java
// sol: dp with two variables
class Solution {
    public int numberOfUniqueGoodSubsequences(String binary) {
        int end0 = 0, end1 = 0;
        int has0 = 0;
        int M = (int) 1e9 + 7;
        for (int i = 0; i < binary.length(); ++i) {
            if (binary.charAt(i) == '1') {
                end1 = (end0 + end1 + 1) % M;
            } else {
                end0 = (end0 + end1) % M;
                has0 = 1;
            }
        }
        return (end0 + end1 + has0) % M;
    }
}
```
