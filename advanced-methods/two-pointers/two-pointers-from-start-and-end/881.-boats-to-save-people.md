# 881. Boats to Save People

## Question

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return _the minimum number of boats to carry every given person._&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong><strong>Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 104`
* `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 104`

## Solution

#### Java

```java
// sol: sort, two pointers
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        int left = 0, right = people.length - 1;
        int res = 0;
        Arrays.sort(people);
        while (left <= right) {
            if (people[left] + people[right] <= limit) {
                ++left;
            }
            --right;
            ++res;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
