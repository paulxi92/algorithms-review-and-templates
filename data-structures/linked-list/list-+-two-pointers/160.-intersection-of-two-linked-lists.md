# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

## Question

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

It is **guaranteed** that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160\_example\_1\_1.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160\_example\_3.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
* The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
* `0 <= m, n <= 3 * 10^4`
* `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
* `0 <= skipA <= m`
* `0 <= skipB <= n`
* `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
* `intersectVal == listA[skipA + 1] == listB[skipB + 1]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?

## Solution

#### C++

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        // sol: two pointers (make two cycles)
        if (!headA || !headB) {
            return NULL;
        }
        ListNode* a = headA;
        ListNode* b = headB;
        while (a != b) {
            a = a ? a->next : headB; // tail NULL included
            b = b ? b->next : headA;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```

#### Java

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */

// sol: two pointers (make two cycles)
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode a = headA, b = headB;
        while (a != b) {
            a = a != null ? a.next : headB;
            b = b != null ? b.next : headA;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
