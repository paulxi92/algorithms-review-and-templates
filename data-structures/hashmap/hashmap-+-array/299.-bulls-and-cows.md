# 299. Bulls and Cows

## Question

You are playing the [**Bulls and Cows**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls\_and\_Cows) game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

* The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
* The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB"`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1807"
  |
"7810"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
Output: "1A1B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1123"        "1123"
  |      or     |
"0111"        "0111"
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: secret = "1", guess = "0"
Output: "0A0B"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: secret = "1", guess = "1"
Output: "1A0B"
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`
* `secret.length == guess.length`
* `secret` and `guess` consist of digits only.

## Solution

#### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string getHint(string secret, string guess) {
        // sol: hashmap, two passes
        int n = secret.size();
        vector<int> m(256, 0); // store number of unequal chars in secret
        int bull = 0, cow = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { // iterate secret
            if (secret[i] == guess[i]) {
                ++bull;
            } else {
                ++m[secret[i]];
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { // iterate guess
            if (secret[i] != guess[i] && m[guess[i]] > 0) {
                ++cow;
                --m[guess[i]];
            }
        }
        return to_string(bull) + "A" + to_string(cow) + "B";
    }
};
```

#### Java

```java
// sol: hashmap, two passes
class Solution {
    public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
        int n = secret.length();
        HashMap<Character, Integer> m = new HashMap<>(); // map unmatched char to freq
        int a = 0, b = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (secret.charAt(i) == guess.charAt(i)) {
                ++a;
            } else {
                m.put(secret.charAt(i), m.getOrDefault(secret.charAt(i), 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (secret.charAt(i) != guess.charAt(i) && m.containsKey(guess.charAt(i)) && m.get(guess.charAt(i)) > 0) {
                ++b;
                m.put(guess.charAt(i), m.get(guess.charAt(i)) - 1);
            }
        }
        return String.valueOf(a) + "A" + String.valueOf(b) + "B";
    }
}
```
