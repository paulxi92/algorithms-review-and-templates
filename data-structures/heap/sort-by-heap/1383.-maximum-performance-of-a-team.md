# 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team

## Question

You are given two integers `n` and `k` and two integer arrays `speed` and `efficiency` both of length `n`. There are `n` engineers numbered from `1` to `n`. `speed[i]` and `efficiency[i]` represent the speed and efficiency of the `ith` engineer respectively.

Choose **at most** `k` different engineers out of the `n` engineers to form a team with the maximum **performance**.

The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.

Return _the maximum performance of this team_. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
Output: 60
Explanation: 
We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3
Output: 68
Explanation:
This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team. That is, performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) = 68.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 4
Output: 72
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5`
* `speed.length == n`
* `efficiency.length == n`
* `1 <= speed[i] <= 10^5`
* `1 <= efficiency[i] <= 10^8`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPerformance(int n, vector<int>& speed, vector<int>& efficiency, int k) {
        // sol: sort, min heap
        vector<vector<int>> nodes(n);
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> q; // min heap for speed
        long speed_sum = 0, res = 0, mod = 1e9 + 7;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            nodes[i] = {speed[i], efficiency[i]};
        }
        auto cmp = [](vector<int>& v1, vector<int>& v2) {
            return v1[1] > v2[1];
        };
        sort(nodes.begin(), nodes.end(), cmp);
        for (auto node : nodes) {
            if (q.size() > k - 1) {
                speed_sum -= q.top();
                q.pop();
            }
            speed_sum += node[0];
            q.push(node[0]);
            res = max(res, speed_sum * node[1]);
        }
        return res % mod;
    }
};
```
