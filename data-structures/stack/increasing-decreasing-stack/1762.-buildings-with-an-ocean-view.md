# 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View

## Question

There are `n` buildings in a line. You are given an integer array `heights` of size `n` that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a **smaller** height.

Return a list of indices **(0-indexed)** of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
</strong><strong>Output: [0,2,3]
</strong><strong>Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]
</strong><strong>Output: [0,1,2,3]
</strong><strong>Explanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: heights = [1,3,2,4]
</strong><strong>Output: [3]
</strong><strong>Explanation: Only building 3 has an ocean view. 
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= heights.length <= 105`
* `1 <= heights[i] <= 109`

## Solution

#### Java

```java
// sol: stack (decreasing)
class Solution {
    public int[] findBuildings(int[] heights) {
        int n = heights.length;
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();  
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            while (!st.isEmpty() && heights[st.peek()] < heights[i]) {
                st.pop();
            }
            if (st.isEmpty()) { 
                res.add(i);
            }
            st.push(i);
        }
        Collections.reverse(res);
        return res.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray();
    }
}
```
