# 1029. Two City Scheduling

## Question

A company is planning to interview `2n` people. Given the array `costs` where `costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti]`, the cost of flying the `ith` person to city `a` is `aCosti`, and the cost of flying the `ith` person to city `b` is `bCosti`.

Return _the minimum cost to fly every person to a city_ such that exactly `n` people arrive in each city.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
</strong><strong>Output: 110
</strong><strong>Explanation: 
</strong>The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: costs = [[259,770],[448,54],[926,667],[184,139],[840,118],[577,469]]
</strong><strong>Output: 1859
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: costs = [[515,563],[451,713],[537,709],[343,819],[855,779],[457,60],[650,359],[631,42]]
</strong><strong>Output: 3086
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `2 * n == costs.length`
* `2 <= costs.length <= 100`
* `costs.length` is even.
* `1 <= aCosti, bCosti <= 1000`

## Solution

#### Java

```java
// sol: greedy
class Solution {
    public int twoCitySchedCost(int[][] costs) {
        Arrays.sort(costs, (o1, o2) -> (o1[0] - o1[1]) - (o2[0] - o2[1]));
        int k = costs.length / 2;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            res += costs[i][0] + costs[i + k][1];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
