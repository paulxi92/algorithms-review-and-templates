# 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe

## Question

Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an `n x n` board between two players:

1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
3. A player who succeeds in placing `n` of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Implement the `TicTacToe` class:

* `TicTacToe(int n)` Initializes the object the size of the board `n`.
* `int move(int row, int col, int player)` Indicates that player with id `player` plays at the cell `(row, col)` of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move.

**Follow up:**  
Could you do better than `O(n2)` per `move()` operation?

**Example 1:**

```text
Input
["TicTacToe", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]
[[3], [0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1]]
Output
[null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation
TicTacToe ticTacToe = new TicTacToe(3);
Assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.
ticTacToe.move(0, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(0, 2, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(2, 2, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 1, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 0, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 1, 1); // return 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 100`
* player is `1` or `2`.
* `1 <= row, col <= n`
* `(row, col)` are **unique** for each different call to `move`.
* At most `n2` calls will be made to `move`.

## Solution

```cpp
class TicTacToe {
public:
    // sol: counting with +1/-1
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    TicTacToe(int n) : N(n), diag(0), rdiag(0) {
        rows.resize(n);
        cols.resize(n);
    }
    
    /** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins. */
    int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int inc = player == 1 ? 1 : -1;
        rows[row] += inc;
        cols[col] += inc;
        if (row == col) {
            diag += inc;
        }
        if (row + col == N - 1) {
            rdiag += inc;
        }
        return (abs(rows[row]) == N || abs(cols[col]) == N || abs(diag) == N || abs(rdiag) == N) ? player : 0;
    }
    
private:
    int N;
    vector<int> rows, cols;
    int diag, rdiag;
};

/**
 * Your TicTacToe object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TicTacToe* obj = new TicTacToe(n);
 * int param_1 = obj->move(row,col,player);
 */
```
