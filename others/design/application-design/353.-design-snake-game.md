# 353. Design Snake Game

## Question

Design a [Snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28video_game%29) that is played on a device with screen size `height x width`. [Play the game online](http://patorjk.com/games/snake/) if you are not familiar with the game.

The snake is initially positioned at the top left corner `(0, 0)` with a length of `1` unit.

You are given an array `food` where `food[i] = (ri, ci)` is the row and column position of a piece of food that the snake can eat. When a snake eats a piece of food, its length and the game's score both increase by `1`.

Each piece of food appears one by one on the screen, meaning the second piece of food will not appear until the snake eats the first piece of food.

When a piece of food appears on the screen, it is **guaranteed** that it will not appear on a block occupied by the snake.

The game is over if the snake goes out of bounds \(hits a wall\) or if its head occupies a space that its body occupies **after** moving \(i.e. a snake of length 4 cannot run into itself\).

Implement the `SnakeGame` class:

* `SnakeGame(int width, int height, int[][] food)` Initializes the object with a screen of size `height x width` and the positions of the `food`.
* `int move(String direction)` Returns the score of the game after applying one `direction` move by the snake. If the game is over, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/13/snake.jpg)

```text
Input
["SnakeGame", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]
[[3, 2, [[1, 2], [0, 1]]], ["R"], ["D"], ["R"], ["U"], ["L"], ["U"]]
Output
[null, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, -1]

Explanation
SnakeGame snakeGame = new SnakeGame(3, 2, [[1, 2], [0, 1]]);
snakeGame.move("R"); // return 0
snakeGame.move("D"); // return 0
snakeGame.move("R"); // return 1, snake eats the first piece of food. The second piece of food appears
                     // at (0, 1).
snakeGame.move("U"); // return 1
snakeGame.move("L"); // return 2, snake eats the second food. No more food appears.
snakeGame.move("U"); // return -1, game over because snake collides with border
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= width, height <= 10^4`
* `1 <= food.length <= 50`
* `food[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ri < height`
* `0 <= ci < width`
* `direction.length == 1`
* `direction` is `'U'`, `'D'`, `'L'`, or `'R'`.
* At most `10^4` calls will be made to `move`.

## Solution

```cpp
class SnakeGame {
public:
    // sol: deque
    /** Initialize your data structure here.
        @param width - screen width
        @param height - screen height 
        @param food - A list of food positions
        E.g food = [[1,1], [1,0]] means the first food is positioned at [1,1], the second is at [1,0]. */
    SnakeGame(int width, int height, vector<vector<int>>& food) {
        this->width = width;
        this->height = height;
        this->food = food;
        score = 0;
        snake.push_back({0, 0});
    }
    
    /** Moves the snake.
        @param direction - 'U' = Up, 'L' = Left, 'R' = Right, 'D' = Down 
        @return The game's score after the move. Return -1 if game over. 
        Game over when snake crosses the screen boundary or bites its body. */
    int move(string direction) {
        auto head = snake.front();
        auto tail = snake.back();
        snake.pop_back(); // remove tail here o.w. head can reach tail
        if (direction == "U") {
            --head[0];
        } else if (direction == "D") {
            ++head[0];
        } else if (direction == "L") {
            --head[1];
        } else if (direction == "R") {
            ++head[1];
        }
        if (head[0] < 0 || head[0] >= height || head[1] < 0 || head[1] >= width || count(snake.begin(), snake.end(), head)) {
            return -1;
        }
        snake.push_front(head);
        if (!food.empty() && head == food[0]) {
            food.erase(food.begin());
            snake.push_back(tail);
            ++score;
        }
        return score;
    }
    
private:
    int width, height, score;
    vector<vector<int>> food;
    deque<vector<int>> snake;
};

/**
 * Your SnakeGame object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * SnakeGame* obj = new SnakeGame(width, height, food);
 * int param_1 = obj->move(direction);
 */
```
